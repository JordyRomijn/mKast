# Creating Placeholder Images for the Game Launcher 

## Overview

Placeholder images add a professional look to your game launcher even when custom artwork isn't available. This guide explains how to create effective placeholder images for your games.

## Types of Placeholder Images

The Game Launcher now supports three types of placeholder images:

1. **Default System Placeholder**: Generated automatically when no image is specified
2. **Custom Game-Specific Placeholders**: You can create placeholders based on game names
3. **Genre-Based Placeholders**: Using different placeholder styles for different game genres

## How to Create Effective Placeholders

Good placeholder images should:

1. **Communicate Game Type**: Use simple symbols that indicate the genre
2. **Be Simple**: Use minimal colors and design elements
3. **Be Legible**: Include readable text for the game title
4. **Have Consistent Style**: Match your launcher's visual theme

## Creating Custom Placeholders

### Basic Placeholder Template

```
[Game Name]
   |
   |--- Simple graphic symbol
   |
[Game Genre]
```

### Color-Coding by Genre

Consider using consistent colors to indicate game genre:

- **Action Games**: Red/Orange tones
- **Strategy Games**: Blue/Purple tones
- **Simulation Games**: Green tones
- **Puzzle Games**: Yellow tones
- **RPG Games**: Purple/Gold tones

### Tools For Creating Placeholders

- Use the same pixel art tools mentioned in the main guide
- Create a template file you can easily modify for each game
- Save placeholders in PNG format at 128x128 or 256x256 resolution

## Adding Text to Placeholders

For text in placeholders:

1. Use large, readable pixel fonts
2. Keep game title to 1-2 words if possible
3. Use high contrast between text and background
4. Consider adding a drop shadow for better readability

## Automatic Placeholder Generation

The launcher now includes a feature that generates placeholders automatically:

1. It uses the first letter of the game name
2. It generates a consistent color based on the game name
3. It adds a simple controller icon

## Advanced Placeholder Techniques

- **Color Gradients**: Add subtle gradients for a modern look
- **Silhouettes**: Use game character silhouettes for recognizable games
- **Logo Focus**: For well-known games, focus on a simplified logo
- **Dynamic Elements**: Create animated placeholders for special games
